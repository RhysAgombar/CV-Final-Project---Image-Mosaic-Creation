# CV-Final-Project---Image-Mosaic-Creation
Image Mosaic Creation Program

Final project for Computer Vision course. The program consists of two implementations: static and dynamically sized mosaic modes. 

Both mosaic programs work by analysing the texture and colour of segments of the image, and then finding similar matches in a provided image set. The textures were analysed by using an LM Filter Bank, and the colour was analysed finding the most prevelent colours in the images and comparing them. For simplicities sake, I used the Describable Textures Dataset for image matching.
